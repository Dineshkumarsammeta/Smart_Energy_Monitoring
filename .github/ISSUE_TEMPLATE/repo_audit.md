## ðŸ”Ž Audit Summary
A review of the repository identified the following issues:

- ðŸš« **No tagged releases** â€“ versioning and release history are missing.  
- ðŸ“­ **No Issues/PRs** â€“ no tracking of bugs, feature requests, or contributions.  
- ðŸ§ª **Limited test coverage** â€“ only a single `test.py` file is present; no unit/integration test suite.  
- ðŸ“Š **No metrics/artifacts** â€“ expected outputs (CSV/PNG files from experiments) are not tracked or generated as part of the CI/CD pipeline.  

---

## âœ… Recommendations
- [ ] Introduce **semantic versioning** and create tagged releases.  
- [ ] Start using GitHub **Issues/PRs** to manage bugs, features, and contributions.  
- [ ] Expand **test coverage** (e.g., `pytest`) to cover key modules.  
- [ ] Configure CI/CD to produce and store **metrics/artifacts** (CSV, PNG, logs).  
- [ ] Add **badges** (build, coverage, license) to `README.md` for visibility.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
Please review and decide on:  
1. Priority areas to address first.  
2. Timeline for implementing fixes.  
3. Assignment of responsibilities.
