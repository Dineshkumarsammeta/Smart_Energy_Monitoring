# Smart_Energy_Monitoring

# Project Title
*Smart Energy Monitoring for Indian Hospitals*

## üìÖ Project Timeline

- **Duration:** 10 August 2010 ‚Äì 8 October  2010(Part-Time)  
- **Acadamic Year:** 1st year of Electrical and Electronics Engineering
- **Location:** VIT University, Vellore, India 



## üìå Objective
Constructed¬†a low-cost, Internet of Things-based system to monitor and optimise energy consumption in a hospital ward in India, minimising waste and peak load.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project was originally built in 2010 as part of academic research at VIT University. which is part time project.

Modernisation note: This project was originally built in Aug‚ÄìOct 2010. In Sep 2025, I uploaded the code to GitHub and refreshed it to run on current tooling (Python 3.11; added mock‚Äëbased tests, CI and metrics). Commit dates reflect publication/cleanup, not the original build period.

The RS485 serial communication code in this project communicates with particular hardware devices that are attached to a serial port (/dev/ttyUSB0).

Crucial Information:

For the code to function properly, an RS485 adapter or other appropriate device must be attached.

Running this code in Continuous Integration (CI) will likely fail since CI systems (including GitHub Actions) cannot access actual hardware.

The repository is kept open to highlight:

Python (pyserial) handling of serial communication

Methods for data gathering and logging

Workflow examples for tasks involving hardware

Suggestion:

The script must be executed on a local machine with the relevant RS485 hardware attached in order to function properly.

To replicate hardware input without requiring real devices, consider mocking the serial interface for automated runs or CI testing.

## üìä Repository Health

This project is under continuous improvement.  
An [Audit Report](../../issues/1) has been created to track repository health and enhancements:  
- Releases & versioning (to be added)  
- Expanded test coverage (planned with `pytest`)  
- Metrics/artifacts integration (CSV/PNG export in CI)  



## üè• Background & Relevance
Due to ineffective HVAC control, lighting, and machine idle, Indian hospitals frequently waste energy. 
The goal of this research was to enable focused interventions by measuring and analysing consumption in real time.
