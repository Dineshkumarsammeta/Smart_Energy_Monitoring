# Smart_Energy_Monitoring

# Project Title
*Smart Energy Monitoring for Indian Hospitals*

## üìÖ Project Timeline
**Duration:** August 2010 ‚Äì October  2010  
**Location:** VIT University, Vellore, India 


## üìå Objective
Constructed¬†a low-cost, Internet of Things-based system to monitor and optimise energy consumption in a hospital ward in India, minimising waste and peak load.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

The RS485 serial communication code in this project communicates with particular hardware devices that are attached to a serial port (/dev/ttyUSB0).

Crucial Information:

For the code to function properly, an RS485 adapter or other appropriate device must be attached.

Running this code in Continuous Integration (CI) will probably fail since CI systems, including GitHub Actions, are unable to access actual hardware.

The repository is kept open to the public for demonstration and instructional purposes in order to highlight:

Python (pyserial) handling of serial communication

Methods for data gathering and logging

Workflow example for tasks involving hardware

Suggestion:

The script must be executed on a local computer with the relevant RS485 hardware attached in order to function properly.

To replicate hardware input without the need for real devices, think about mocking the serial interface for automated runs or continuous integration testing.

## üìä Repository Health

This project is under continuous improvement.  
An [Audit Report](../../issues/1) has been created to track repository health and enhancements:  
- Releases & versioning (to be added)  
- Expanded test coverage (planned with `pytest`)  
- Metrics/artifacts integration (CSV/PNG export in CI)  



## üè• Background & Relevance
Due to ineffective HVAC control, lighting, and machine idle, Indian hospitals frequently waste energy. 
The goal of this research was to enable focused interventions by measuring and analysing consumption in real time.
