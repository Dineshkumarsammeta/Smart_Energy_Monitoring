# Project Title
*Smart Energy Monitoring for Indian Hospitals*

## 📅 Project Timeline
**Duration:** Auguest 2010 – October  2010  
**Location:** VIT University, Vellore, India  
**Modules Used:** EEE105 – Basic Electrical Engineering, PHY101 – Modern Physics

## 📌 Objective
Constructed a low-cost, Internet of Things-based system to monitor and optimise energy consumption in a hospital ward in India, minimising waste and peak load.


## 🏥 Background & Relevance
Due to ineffective HVAC control, lighting, and machine idle, Indian hospitals frequently waste energy. 
The goal of this research was to enable focused interventions by measuring and analysing consumption in real time.


## ⚙️ Methodology
Arduino Uno with CT sensors for current measurement

RS-485 communication to central PC

Data logging in CSV format

MATLAB Simulink model for load profile analysis

Simulation using Tamil Nadu Electricity Board tariff data
