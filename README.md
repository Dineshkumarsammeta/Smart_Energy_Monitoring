# Smart_Energy_Monitoring

# Project Title
*Smart Energy Monitoring for Indian Hospitals*

## 📅 Project Timeline
**Duration:** Auguest 2010 – October  2010  
**Location:** VIT University, Vellore, India  
**Modules Used:** EEE105 – Basic Electrical Engineering, PHY101 – Modern Physics

## 📌 Objective
Constructed a low-cost, Internet of Things-based system to monitor and optimise energy consumption in a hospital ward in India, minimising waste and peak load.


## 🏥 Background & Relevance
Due to ineffective HVAC control, lighting, and machine idle, Indian hospitals frequently waste energy. 
The goal of this research was to enable focused interventions by measuring and analysing consumption in real time.
