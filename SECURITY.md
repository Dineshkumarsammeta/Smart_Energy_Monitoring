📧 Contact: sammetadineshkumar@gmail.com

🔒 Do not open a public GitHub Issue for sensitive reports.

⏱️ You can expect an acknowledgment within 7 days.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project relies on RS485 hardware communication. Since CI pipelines cannot access hardware, some parts of the code are mock-based. Security updates apply only to the Python software components (logging, replay, mock testing) and not to hardware dependencies.
