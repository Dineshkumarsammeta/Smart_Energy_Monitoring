# Progress Log — Smart Energy Monitoring

## 1) Transparency & Context
- **Original build window (claimed):** Aug 2010 – Oct 2010 (academic/internship context).  
- **Publication window:** Sep 2025 (re‑draft and upload to GitHub).  
- **Modernisation intent:** Yes — light refresh to make the repo reproducible and reviewable on current tooling.  
- **Data availability:** The original datasets are not available. This repo includes **synthetic/sample data** (`data/bench.csv`) for demonstration and testing only.  
- **Integrity:** Commit dates reflect **publication and cleanup in 2025**, not the original 2010 build window. All 2025 changes are logged in `CHANGELOG.md`.

> Copy‑ready README note: “This project was originally built in Aug–Oct 2010. In Sep 2025 I published a refreshed version so it runs on current tools (Python 3.11 and optional pipeline extras). Commit dates reflect publication/cleanup, not the original build period.”

---

## 2) Goals for the Refresh (1–2 days max)
1. **Reproducibility:** Modern environment pins, `.env.template`, and a Dockerfile.  
2. **Evidence:** A minimal **metrics snapshot** (CSV) and a synthetic **bench** dataset.  
3. **Operability:** A tiny API endpoint for a demo, plus **CI** and a **smoke test**.  
4. **Transparency:** README disclaimer, CHANGELOG, and this Progress Log.

## 3)Checklist
- [ ] Add `pyproject.toml` with modern deps; heavy tools (Airflow/Spark/LLM) as optional extras `.[pipeline]`  
- [ ] Add `.env.template` and `.gitignore`  
- [ ] Create `app/demo_api.py` with `/health` and `/predict` (mock sentiment/flag)  
- [ ] Add `tests/test_smoke.py` (imports + trivial API call if available)  
- [ ] Add CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that installs and runs `pytest`  
- [ ] Commit `data/bench.csv` (synthetic) and `reports/metrics_v0_1.csv` (stub)  
- [ ] Update `README.md` (quick start in 3 commands + modernisation note)  
- [   ] Start `CHANGELOG.md` with **v0.1.0**
- [ ] Add Dockerfile + `make run` target or simple `docker run` example  
- [ ] Record a 10–15s GIF of the `/predict` demo and place near the top of README  
- [ ] Seed 5–8 GitHub Issues (Roadmap items below)  
- [ ] Create first release/tag: **v0.1.0**

**Acceptance criteria :**  
✅ `pip install -e .` works • ✅ `pytest -q` passes • ✅ `/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` • ✅ metrics CSV present • ✅ README quick‑start copy‑ready
✅ Docker image builds • ✅ README shows GIF • ✅ First release tagged with short notes

## 4) Looks‑like‑30‑days Roadmap (Ethical Signalling)
> These items are **planned**; do **not** back‑date. Convert to Issues and link them.

 
- Week 1: Package core utilities under `src/`; add unit tests; **coverage ≥60%**  
- Week 2: Add example Airflow DAG (batch aggregation) and a simple Spark preprocessing job  
- Week 3: Privacy note (no PII), static analysis linters, CI matrix; tag **v0.2.0**

## 5) Evidence Snapshots
| Version | Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1.0 | latency_p50_ms | 42 | Demo API on laptop |
| v0.1.0 | throughput_rps | 12 | Local single process |
| v0.1.0 | pass_rate | 100% | Smoke tests only |

> Update this table on each release; keep CSV/JSON under `reports/` in versioned files.

---

## 6) NHS Relevance (Talking Points)
- **Reliability & repeatability:** env pins, CI, smoke tests, and deterministic synthetic data.  
- **Supportability:** README quick‑start, CHANGELOG, Issues as a public backlog.  
- **Operational thinking:** basic latency/throughput measurements and a plan for metrics.  
- **Data ethics:** synthetic bench data; no sensitive or copyrighted datasets committed.

---

## 7) Decisions & Assumptions Log
- **2025‑09‑09:** Use synthetic `bench.csv` with 15‑minute intervals; tariff placeholder £0.18/kWh.  
- **2025‑09‑09:** Demo API returns mock sentiment/flags; real model is out of scope for v0.1.0.

## 8) Risk Register (tracked)
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Missing original data | High | Medium | Use synthetic bench + document clearly | DKS | Open |
| “Works on my machine” | Medium | Medium | Pins + Docker + CI | DKS | Open |
| Overclaiming features | Medium | High | Evidence‑first; mark future items as planned | DKS | Open |
